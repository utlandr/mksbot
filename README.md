### MksBot - Observing gamers in their natural habitat
MksBot is my quick Python implementation of a Discord. Currently, he works on a single server to entertain the monkeys (a.k.a my friends and I) in various ways. 
#### Features
MksBot has the following features:

- Reddit web scraping using the PRAW module
- Randomised replies to users
- User information scraping

#### Improvements
I plan to add the following:

- Voice channels/automated tasks
- Better code structure and configuration parsing
